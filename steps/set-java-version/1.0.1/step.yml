title: Set Java version
summary: This Step helps you set an already installed Java version on the virtual machine.
description: |
  This Step can't install any Java version. You can only pick from the already installed versions.
  If you want to install other Java versions, check out [Using a Java version not installed on our Android stacks](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/infrastructure/virtual-machines/#using-a-java-version-not-installed-on-our-android-stacks).
  
  ### Configuring the Step
  1. In the **Java version to be set globally for the build** input, select an installed Java version you wish to use during the build run.

  ### Troubleshooting
  If the Step fails to set the Java version, you can use these [scripts](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/infrastructure/virtual-machines/#managing-java-versions) as a temporary workaround.
